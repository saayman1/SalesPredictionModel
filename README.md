# SalesPredictionModel
A project done during the MIT Applied Data Science Program under Great Learning.  We are building a predictive model using trained data and have test data to test the model against. 
Problem Statement: Build a predictive model that can find out the sales of each product at a particular store and then provide actionable recommendations to the BigMart sales team to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.
